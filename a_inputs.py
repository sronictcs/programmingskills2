#writing clear prompts
#using user inputs

#a input statement takes the user input and stores it in a variable
name = input("Please enter your name: ")
print (f"\nHello, {name}!")

#3-1 create a variable called age and ask the user their age

#to move on to a new line in Python we use \n
print("Hello, i'm on one line \n and i'm on another.")

#3-2 write a print statement over 2 lines using \n

#3-3. Rental Car: Write a program that asks the user
#what kind of rental car they would like.
#Print a message about that car, such
#as “Let me see if I can find you a Subaru.”


#Python assumes all data being inputted is a string.
#A string is a collection letters, numbers or characters.
#strings are surrounded by quotes. Below is a string.
tv_show = "the simpsons"

#You can check what type of input a user has made by checking the type
#of the variable holding the input using the type() function.
age = input("What is your age")
print(type(age))

#another types of variable is an integer - or int (a whole number) you can
#use a integer in a variable by typing it with no quote. See below:
age = 15


#To make a variable a specific data type like an int use the int function like
#below:
age = input("Enter your age")
print(age)
age = int(age)
print (type(age))


#Another way to do this is to apply the int function to the input function.
#See below:
age = int(input("Enter your age"))

#3-4 use an input statement to store a users favourite number as an int



#3-5 Write a program that takes a users input and returns the
#number squared.
