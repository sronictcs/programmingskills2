'''2-3. Your Own List: Think of your favorite mode of
transportation,
such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores
several examples.
Use your list to print a series of statements about these
items, such as
“I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”'''

'''2-4. Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite?
Make a list that includes at least three people you’d like to invite to dinner.
Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.'''

#to change an item in a list replace the element with an =
#e.g. cars[2] = "hyundai"
cars = ["bmw", "audi", "toyota", "subaru"]
print(cars)
cars[2] = "hyundai"
print(cars)

#to add to the end of list use .append()
cars.append["ford"]
print(cars)


#to insert to a position in a list use .insert(position, "item")
cars.insert(2, "volvo")
print(cars)

'''2-5. Changing Guest List: You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the dinner,
so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of someone else to invite.
•	Start with your program from Exercise 3-4.
Add a print() call at the end of your program stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.
•	Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest
who can’t make it with the name of the new person you are inviting.
•	Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person
who is still in your list.'''

2-6. More Guests: You just found a bigger
dinner table, so now more space is available.
Think of three more guests to invite to dinner.
•	Start with your program from Exercise 3-4 or Exercise 3-5.
Add a print() call to the end of your program informing people that
you found a bigger dinner table.
•	Use insert() to add one new guest to the beginning of your list.
•	Use insert() to add one new guest to the middle of your list.
•	Use append() to add one new guest to the end of your list.
•	Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list
